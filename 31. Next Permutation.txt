Didn't work it out.

The concept of permutation is not that easy to understand at first. However, it is harder 
to figure out a not straight forward solution as it would be too expensive. The algorithm 
seems to be very easy if you only try to remember the conclusion it offers, but it may cause 
unpleasant consequence in an interview.

The link below is a solution provided by others, and the comments below includes a link to a 
video explaning the principle behind the algorithm.
