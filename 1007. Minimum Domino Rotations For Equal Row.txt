Didn't work it out.
The key is that the possible nubmer can only be A[0] and B[0], and there is no minimum number of rotations as if A[0]
and B[0] are both possible, then either A[0] = B[0] or the numbers of rotations are the same. So we only need to test 
the numbers of rotations based on A[0] and B[0], when there is a solution.

Other's solution.
